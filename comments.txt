It's important to note that the component will re-render any time the value returned from useSelector
changes to a new reference. Components should always try to select the smallest possible amount of data
they need from the store, which will help ensure that it only renders when it actually needs to.

If an action needs to contain a unique ID or some other random value, always generate that first and put
it in the action object. Reducers should never calculate random values, because that makes the results
unpredictable.
